				<p>My education life start since I am 7 years old until now. I am happy and thankful for this opportunity in 
			education part. At that time we live in Johor and my first primary school is Sekolah Kebangsaan Kampong Pasir (SKKP) 
			and Sekolah Agama Dato Omar Yusof Johor Bahru, Johor. For myself, I live in Johor for nine (9) years which is until 
			I am 9 years old. What I have stated, 2010 we go to Selangor and live there. From that, my second primary school is 
			Sekolah Kebangsaan Meru (SK Meru) Jalan Tap, Kapar and Sekolah Rendah Agama Meru II, Meru Klang Selangor. This site 
			is not a diary but I want to say that I dont like to stay in Selangor for the first time. It is because I loved to stay 
			in Johor, my hometown and I really missed the environment and memories there. Now, its already 10 years and I am already 
			20 years old but i am still missed Johor Bahru.</p>
	<br>
				<p>As I am the third child, I am the one that study in University.</p>
	<br>
				<p>In Sk Meru, I go to the same school with my brother. He is 11 years old and I am 10 years old. In my family, only us 
			that are schooling there. It is something that i will never forget  which is the memories schooling together with my brother.
			After we finished the primary school, we separated which is my brother and I go to different school. I've choose to go to the 
			same school with my older sister. It is Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Perempuan Kapar (SMK(P)K). From the school name we know that 
			it is a school that only for female students. I've study there from I am 13 years old until 17. Along the years,my school life 
			cycle at that time is only school-go back home-school. I have lack communication with male people except my family members and 
			teachers.

			have finish my life, I've continue study in local university in Malaysia which named University of Technology Mara Kedah Branch. For the first time
			study at the university is not easy. It is normal for fresh student that still not adapt with university environment. For me, I am willing to study
			here eventhough it will make me stay far from my family. It is one of my dream actually. My course field at the university is Library Management (IM120) 
			under the Faculty of Information Management.</font></p>

				<p align="justify" font face="Cambria (body)" font size="5" font color="black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got new friends and experience that not 
			every people get. The "Library Management" course field is not as easy as what people expect. It is normal when before we start to study this course 
			we thing this course is simple. Like people said, just learn "how to arrange books on the bookshelf". But, after we go through of the subjects, it is 
			not simple as people say. I know every course field have their own difficulties same goes to library management. People never understand if they 
			did not in the same shoes with that person. Thats the reality of life. However, I am very thankful to God for giving us (my friends and I) a chance
			to continue our study and gain new knowledges and experience and we almost finished our diploma in the middle of 2020. In 2021 I continue my study 
			for Degree in Records Management field. More knowledge that I get with different course. Entering UiTM Segamat is also my dreams. It is because 
			I want to study in Johor.</font></p>
